>You suddenly remember you need to call your aunt and wish her a happy birthday, but how do you find her number quickly in a giant phonebook? Write a program that will solve this problem once and forever: create a phonebook where you can easily, quickly and efficiently find necessary information. Names and numbers, here we come.

## Learning outcomes
You will learn a variety of sorting and search algorithms, one of which is recursive. If it is algorithm competence that youâ€™re after, this project is definitely for you.
