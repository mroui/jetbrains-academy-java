:muscle: Medium :link: [hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/81)

>Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!
## Learning outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using classes and methods, handling errors, and processing user input. You will also learn to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.
