>Not to sound overly serious, but itâ€™s very important to manage your budget. This implies analyzing your expenses and estimating the income, which sometimes may be difficult to do yourself. Luckily, technology is there to assist: you can create your own personal budget manager program that counts the ins and outs and helps control the finances.

## Learning outcomes
You will create a very applicable product, and in the meanwhile also get acquainted with the basic concepts of programming in Java. You will deal with the widest variety of tools: work with strings, perform mathematical calculations and sort the data.
