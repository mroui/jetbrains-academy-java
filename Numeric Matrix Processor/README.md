# Numeric Matrix Processor
:muscle: Medium :link: [hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/60)

>Hereâ€™s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

## Learning outcomes
Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using arrays in practice.
